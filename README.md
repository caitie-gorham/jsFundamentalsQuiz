## Details

This application is a timed JavaScript quiz. This application is not complete. It takes advantage of Bootstrap for some styling, and regular css for other styling. This application does not use any jQuery because of the requirements of the assignment. 

This application does not currently meet the requirements of the assignment. With further work, I will add:

* A way to hide the buttons when the page first loads except for the "Start Quiz" button
* Have high scores stored in local storage
